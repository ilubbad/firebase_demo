# Building Serverless RESTful Web APIs with Cloud Functions, Firestore, Express and TypeScript

This is a simple API that saves contact information of people. 

## Requirements

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You will need a Firebase project and firebase tools cli

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```





You need to change the firebase project name in *.firebaserc* file.

After that, you can log in to firebase in the terminal 

```
firebase login
```

## Deploy to firebase

For the first time, you have deploy the hosting and functions together

```
firebase deploy
```

After that, you just need to deploy functions only

```
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Trouble shooting 

If you have the **declare namespace FirebaseFirestore**, please comment the content of **node_modules/@google_cloud/firestore/types/firestore.d.ts**. After that you can test the api locally or deploy it to the cloud.

If you cannot do it, please "".firebaserc" has to be deleted and "firebase init" need to be run again." - Thanks to [techboycr](https://github.com/dalenguyen/serverless-rest-api/issues/1).
